This repository serves to 
	
	- give an overview of DSL ecosystems
	- compare the maturity of the contained DSLs with respect to criteria 
		inside their domain and 
		globally

If you like to _assess_ your DSL,

	- fill the data files for your DSL
	- run the analysis for your tool

If you like to _contribute_ the maturity levels of your DSL,
	- create a pull request __/!\ this feedback may take to long__
	-
